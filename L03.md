### N-Channel MOSFET: Physical View
- MOSFET has four electrical terminals: bulk, gate, source and drain

- Two of the device dimensions are under the control of the designer:
  - the channel length: chosen to be as small as possible
  - the channel width: chosen to set the currnt flow to the desired value

- The current, termed I<sub>DS</sub>, flowing across the switch is proportional 
to the ratio of the channel's width to its length.
