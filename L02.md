# The Digital Abstraction

### Encoding Information
What makes a good bit?  
* small, inexpensive
* stable(reliable, repeatable)
* ease and speed of manipulation

### A Digital Processing Element
A combinational device is a circuit element that has
* one or more digital inputs
* one or more digital outputs
* a functional speciification that details the value of each output
for every possible combination of valid input values
* a timing specification consisting(at minimum) of an upper bound t<sub>PD</sub> 
on the required time for the device to compute the specified output values from an 
arbitrary set of stable, valid input values

### A Combinational Digital System
A set of interconnected elements is a combinational device if
* each circuit element is combinational
* every input is connected to exactly one output or to some vast supply of constant
0's and 1's
* the circuit contains on directed cycles
